# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Updated the install target after the repository transfer:

```bash
npx skills add mikemajara/skills --skill backlog
```

- GitHub Issues are now canonical for promoted work. `.backlog/` remains the
  local project memory layer, not a competing task tracker.
- The default backlog structure is now:

```text
.backlog/
  inbox.md
  issues.md
  prds/
  plans/
  memory.md
```

- `.backlog/inbox.md` replaces `.backlog/backlog.md` for rough ideas and tasks
  that are not yet promoted to GitHub Issues.
- `.backlog/issues.md` is a generated/read-only mirror of GitHub Issues.
- `.backlog/memory.md` replaces `.backlog/notes.md` for curated decisions,
  conventions, blockers, gotchas, and durable agent context.
- PRD and plan templates now include an optional `issue` frontmatter field.
- Local PRDs are drafting buffers before GitHub promotion; after promotion,
  delete them or keep a tiny pointer file. GitHub Issues own the canonical
  title, body, status, labels, and discussion—do not maintain duplicate
  editable copies in `.backlog/`.

### Added

- Added `skills/backlog/scripts/backlog-sync.mjs`, an optional dependency-free
  helper that downstream projects can run or copy to regenerate
  `.backlog/issues.md` from GitHub Issues with the GitHub CLI.

### Migration Notes

For projects already using an older `.backlog/` layout:

1. Create the new files if they do not exist:

```text
.backlog/inbox.md
.backlog/issues.md
.backlog/memory.md
```

2. Rename `.backlog/notes.md` to `.backlog/memory.md` and keep the existing
   human-written content. Add a `## Gotchas` section if it would help future
   agents.
3. Review `.backlog/backlog.md`:
   - Move rough, unpromoted items into `.backlog/inbox.md` under `## Inbox`.
   - Promote trackable work to GitHub Issues.
   - Preserve links from related PRDs and plans to their GitHub Issues.
4. Create or regenerate `.backlog/issues.md` from GitHub Issues. Include this
   header:

```markdown
<!-- GENERATED FROM GITHUB ISSUES. DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY. -->
```

5. To enable local GitHub sync, run `skills/backlog/scripts/backlog-sync.mjs`
   from the installed skill or copy it into the downstream project as
   `scripts/backlog-sync.mjs`. The helper discovers the repo from
   `git config --get remote.origin.url`; pass `--repo owner/repo` only when
   overriding that default. If the project has `package.json`, add a script such
   as `"backlog:sync": "node scripts/backlog-sync.mjs"`.
6. Stop manually maintaining `.backlog/backlog.md` once GitHub Issues are
   canonical. Remove or archive it only after confirming its content has moved
   to the inbox, GitHub Issues, PRDs, plans, or memory.

The important invariant is: if an item has a GitHub Issue, GitHub owns its
status.
